# Django Event Feed

A toy project to play with Django Rest Framework.
Only the REST API is coded. No frontend.

Users can create an event (like in Meetup or Eventbrite), delete or edit their events.
Anonymous users can list all the events.
Registered users can also get the detail of an event and see who is attending it.

## Stack

* Django REST Framework
* pytest
* drf-yasg (to generate documentation)
* django-guardian (to use object permissions)
* black (opinonated linter)
